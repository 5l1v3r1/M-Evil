INTRO :
This tool is have 15 sub-tool I called "modules"
Each modules have it own function
M-Evil is actually a new name of BlindEye (previous tool)
But I change the visual look and usage, imitating Metasploit
created by Rapid7... Its just a visual look and usage, all
modules is created in-script, so You can actually add new
module like Metasploit :v

WHAT'S NEW ON THIS VERSION ??? :
- Changing name from 'BlindEye' to 'M-Evil'
- More modules
- Its actually easy to use if You ever use Metasploit
  (I just love Metasploit too much so I want make tools
  like it)
- Colorized :)
  (now work on Windows too)

USAGE :
python2 m-evil.py

Type 'help' and its will show You all the command and modules You can use
